This is a test post to try out the new Quarto framework. I am making a blog in qmd scripts and rendering/publishing in terminal - the simple process is very compelling! I'm participating in the workshop at rconf 2022 to learn how to migrate from RMarkdown to Quarto. I've learned a lot about Quarto, but I've learned even more about R and RMarkdown. I plan to take a step back after this conference and reflect on how I can improve my code and become a better coder.
